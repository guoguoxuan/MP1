Whenever I stand near the edge of a tall building and look down through a window or over a fence, I feel a powerful sense of fear, a fear of heights and of falling. 
My mind instantly fills with “what if” thoughts: What if I slip? How bad would it be if I fell? But where does this feeling come from? 
Is it something we are born with, or something we learn through experience?

So, is fear of heights innate?

The question of whether the fear of heights is innate has been debated for decades. 
One of the most famous experiments exploring this idea is the “visual cliff” study by Eleanor Gibson and Richard Walk in 1960<sup>(1)</sup>.
In this experiment, infants were placed on a glass platform that appeared to have a shallow side and a deep “cliff” side created by a checkerboard pattern underneath.
Mothers encouraged their babies to crawl across the glass toward them. Out of 36 infants aged 6 to 14 months, about 92% refused to cross the cliff, even though they patted the glass.

Similar tests were done with animals. Chicks and lambs less than a day old froze at the “cliff” edge and refused to cross. 
Rats tended to move toward the shallow side, even though both sides were physically the same height, using their whiskers to detect surfaces.
However, kittens reared in the dark showed no avoidance of the cliff until they spent time in the light, suggesting that visual experience is essential for depth perception.
These results suggest that animals (and infants) have an early ability to perceive depth, but that experience sharpens and contextualizes this ability. 
The key question remains: does avoiding the “cliff” mean the infants were afraid?

Some scientists argue that we cannot assume infants avoided the cliff because they were afraid.
That is a circular argument: we think they are afraid because they avoid it and we think they avoid it because they are afraid.
Fear should be demonstrated physiologically (e.g., through heart rate or facial expressions), not just by avoidance.

Psychologist Karen Adolph and her colleagues offered a different perspective<sup>(2)</sup>. 
In one of their studies, 14-month-old infants were asked to walk across bridges of varying widths spanning small or large gaps. 
Interestingly, infants who avoided crossing the risky bridge did not show fear expressions like crying. 
Instead, they often tried to explore the drop, reaching out their hands or attempting to slide down safely.
This suggests that infants perceive depth and potential falling risks, but do not yet understand the consequences. 
Adults, on the other hand, know that falling can be fatal, so we consciously avoid danger. 
Experience, not innate terror, appears to be what transforms curiosity into caution.
Furthermore, infants with more crawling and walking experience made wiser choices like avoiding overly steep slopes. 
This supports the idea that babies learn about their own physical limits, or what psychologists call affordances, which is the information about what actions are possible given one's body and environment. 
So perhaps fear of heights develops gradually, from learning through exploration rather than being hard-wired at birth.

But what happens in the brain? 

The neural circuitry behind fear of heights is still not fully understood. 
A 2021 study in The Journal of Neuroscience explored how neurons in the amygdala, a brain region linked to fear and defensive behaviors, respond when mice are exposed to heights<sup>(3)</sup>. 
Researchers recorded neural activity in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) using electrophysiology. 
They found a group of neurons that became highly active when mice stood on a high platform or were held in the experimenter's hands (cup handling). 
These neurons remained active even after repeated exposures, indicating a consistent response to height.

Further tests showed that these neurons responded more strongly in open platforms (where mice could see the drop) than in enclosed ones, meaning both visual (eyes) and non-visual (whiskers) cues play roles. 
Interestingly, these “high-place” neurons did not respond to other fear-inducing stimuli like loud noises or predator smells, suggesting they specifically encode height-related threat information.

A recent study identifying two novel neural circuits involved in the fear of heights in mice refined the behavioral characterization of the fear response, including metrics like center/edge exploration, retraction, turn around, trembling, and grooming<sup>(4)</sup>.
The research established that visual inputs, not vestibular or whisker somatosensory inputs, are essential for triggering the fear.
Using c-Fos immunostaining, they found that the superior colliculus (SC) and the lateral posterior thalamic nucleus (LPTN) showed increased c-Fos expression, particularly its rostral medial area. 
Chemogenetic inhibition of this circuit paradoxically increased fear of heights without affecting general anxiety.

The most significant finding was a distinct circuit from the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus (vLGN) to the lateral/ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (l/vlPAG). 
The activated vLGN cells were primarily GABAergic and projected to the activated l/vlPAG. Crucially, chemogenetic inhibition of the vLGN → l/vlPAG projection alleviated the fear behavior.
This suggests that the vLGN, a caudal prethalamic area relaying non-image-forming visual information (from intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells), 
is a critical component of the height-fear circuitry, while the dLGN (responsible for image-forming vision) was not activated.
Interestingly, the amygdala did not show the same activation, which differs from the earlier study. This might be due to differences in how “fear of heights” was defined or measured.

It remains an open question how the fear of heights is represented in the brain, and whether the mechanisms observed in mice truly mirror those in humans. 
Humans, unlike other animals, can imagine falling and anticipate pain, which magnifies fear beyond basic sensory perception.

Tightrope walkers provide a remarkable example of how this fear can be overcome through deliberate practice — gradually reshaping the brain's threat-response circuits. 
Similarly, some wild rodents live in elevated environments, an adaptive behavior that likely involves suppressing height-related fear for survival.
Future research could explore how the brain responds not only to static high places but also to sudden vertical changes, such as the sensation of weightlessness. 
Such studies could uncover how fear of heights transitions into fear of falling, and how both responses might be managed or retrained. 
Insights from this work may offer new avenues for treating phobia and anxiety disorders.

Many questions remain unanswered, for example, does age, development, or prior experience influence the emergence of height-related fear?
could there be specialized “height cells” in the brain that encode vertical position or the perception of elevation? If so, is their activity height-dependent?

Perhaps the fear of heights is not an innate terror, but rather a learned adaptation—a cognitive understanding of our body's limits in a vertical world. 
Over time, experience and perception intertwine, creating a protective yet sometimes overwhelming response: our instinctive fear of falling.
