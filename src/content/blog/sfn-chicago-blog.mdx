### SfN 2024
The Society for Neuroscience (SfN) is one of the world's largest neuroscience conferences, uniting thousands of researchers, clinicians, and students to share the latest breakthroughs in brain science.

SfN 2024 was held in Chicago from October 5th to 9th. A few friends from other labs and I were so excited to go and present our workâ€”this was our first time presenting a poster and attending a major conference in the U.S.

The conference was amazing! It provided the perfect platform to meet and connect with fellow researchers, and even get a chance to speak with some of the most famous scientists in our field. It was a great opportunity to exchange ideas and receive valuable feedback from our peers.

What really surprised me was the diversity of work presented at the conference. It's truly eye-opening to see how many directions neuroscience can take. For example, I saw researchers presenting studies on owls, which isn't common in China. It was also inspiring to see how open and welcoming everyone was. People were so willing to answer questions and discuss topics, regardless of their career stage. I learned a lot just by talking to so many different people.

My poster slot was scheduled for the morning of October 8th. I spent a lot of time in my hotel room practicing my pitch and anticipating potential questions. Despite all the preparation, I was still nervous and felt a strong sense of imposter syndrome as I stood by my poster. To my surprise, many people were interested in my research, and we had great conversations. I eventually stopped feeling so nervous, but my throat felt incredibly dry because I had talked so much to everyone who stopped by! It was really nice to have so many people engage and ask insightful questions about my work.

### Exploring Chicago

After the conference, I was so glad to have the chance to explore Chicago with my friends. I especially enjoyed being with a high school classmate who has worked in Seattle for many years. He was the perfect tour guide, and we visited so many amazing places in this incredible city.

We, of course, went to see The Beanâ€”a must-visit spot in Chicago. We also visited the Art Institute of Chicago, the Field Museum, and enjoyed stunning views of the city skyline.

The most unforgettable part was our boat tour of the Chicago River. We somehow ended up on a boat for Spanish-speaking tourists, which was a bit embarrassing because we couldn't understand any of the architectural introductions. We had no interaction with the tour guide or the other people on the boat, which was funny in its own way. Despite the language barrier, the river tour itself was awesome! (By the way, that experience inspired me to start learning Spanish on Duolingo! ðŸ˜…)

lastly, my first time at SfN was truly an amazing and incredible journey. I had the good fortune of not only learning about the latest research and techniques but also engaging in fascinating discussions with both national and international peers. Beyond the conference, I loved exploring the beauty of Chicago with my friends. I hope I'll have more chances to go again in the future.
