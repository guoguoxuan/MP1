I successfully defended my thesis on May 21, 2025!

Looking back, I want to revisit the intense period leading up to that day—how I prepared, the challenges I faced, and the mix of anxieties and determination that carried me through.

The thesis defense is the final major milestone of a PhD journey. Before reaching this stage, students typically face several other key checkpoints: the qualifying exam (around the second year), followed by an annual oral exam to update your research to the committee. Then comes the preliminary oral exam (typically three to four months before the final defense), and finally, the thesis defense itself.

To prepare, I began writing my Chinese dissertation before the Chinese New Year holiday. In my program, we are required to produce at least one English paper. It doesn't need to be published, but it should be plausibly publishable.


About a month before my defense, I started preparing my presentation slides. The most energy-consuming part was creating clear introductory slides that explained the context and background of my work. I kept reminding myself of one principle: I needed to articulate my work logically and clearly for an audience with little background in my specific field. The committee or audience could ask questions from any angle, and I didn't want to disappoint anyone in my defense.

Apart from the presentation, organizing the thesis was a demanding process. Correcting typos and arranging figures in a consistent format were particularly tedious. Sometimes, I couldn’t find any mistakes myself, no matter how many times I read the thesis. It was incredibly helpful to have my labmates review it; their feedback was invaluable, and I’m so grateful for their help.

Another stressful part was all the administrative work—submitting forms, filling tables, and collecting the necessary signatures. This process often dragged on for months, and it was especially tough when my supervisor was slow to respond.

In the last few weeks before the defense, I still hadn’t finished some data analysis. I was balancing three things at once: analyzing data, revising my dissertation, and practicing my talk—every single day until the final date.

Honestly, that last week was particularly challenging emotionally, mentally, and physically. The stress brought on a lot of self-doubt, which haunted me more than at any other point in my Ph.D. I worried that I didn't know the field well enough to "defend" my research, let alone discuss the broader scope of my work. I would often find myself spiraling into negative thoughts. It was an extremely difficult time, and I’m so glad it’s all behind me now.

Despite my nerves and stress, the day of my defense arrived all the same. My presentation lasted about 40–45 minutes, followed by many questions from the audience. After that, everyone, including me, was asked to leave the room so the committee could deliberate behind closed doors.
Most candidates pass their defenses, so this was likely more for them to discuss and write up the focus of my final revisions. Finally, I was asked back into the room and received warm congratulations from my committee.

For me, it was challenging to survive in a lab where the supervisor was often unresponsive. I had to manage my schedules independently and push projects forward under constant pressure and with little direct guidance. Sometimes I felt very frustrated and nd often sought out additional scientific training outside the lab for my project.
However, one of my supervisor's sayings has influenced me a lot: "Being a Ph.D. means you should know something about everything and everything about something." This quote, originally from Thomas Huxley, has motivated me to train myself to be a well-rounded researcher.

Even though I've completed my thesis defense, my academic journey is far from over. The next steps are publishing my current work and applying for postdoctoral positions. I hope to gain more international research experience and explore new scientific fields in the coming years.

Completing the defense was both an ending and a beginning—and I look forward to what’s next.
